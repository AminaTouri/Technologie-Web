    <h1>Virtualization</h1>
    <p>
      In computing, <strong>Virtualization</strong> refers to the act of creationg virtual version of something.
    <br>
      This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.

      <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Level</strong></li>
        <p> Every machine has an instuction set. This Instruction set is an interface between software and hardwar. Using this instuction software can communicate with hardware</p>
        <li><strong>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level</strong></li>
        <p>In Virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 virtual machines at a single time, if we use Virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer
          <br>(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
        <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the
          <br> hardware.</li>
      </ul>
      </ol>
